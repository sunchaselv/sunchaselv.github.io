      <section>
        <h3 id="second-chance">
          Are you a second chance property?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, we are NOT a second chance property and do not offer second chance rentals. If you have a previous eviction, your rental application will be denied.
        </p>
      </section>

	  <section>
        <h3 id="application-requirements">Application requirements / application criteria?</h3>
        <p>Includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No evictions</strong> filed against you, ever—no matter how long ago. Even if the eviction was dismissed in court in your favor.</li>
            <li><strong>Income at least 3x the rent</strong> with legit paystubs to prove it.</li>
            <li><strong>No money owed to other apartments</strong> on your credit report (such as for breaking a lease). Even if you paid them off.</li>
            <li><strong>No sex offenders.</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>By applying, you agree to let us run a credit check and a background check on you. We also ask your previous landlords for references / rental verifications.</p>
        <p>The only way we can tell you if your application would be approved or denied is by submitting an application and paying an application fee. But if any of the above points apply to you, then we recommend that you don't waste your money on the application fee.</p>
	  </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="section-8">Do you take Section 8 housing authority vouchers?</h3>
        <p>
          No, we do not take Section 8.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="how-much-to-move-in"> How much to move in? </h3>
        <p>Generally, we ask for the <strong>first month's rent + a security deposit</strong>, which starts at $200 and depends on your credit and application. We don't charge extra surprise "admin fees," "cleaning deposits," or stuff like that you're probably used to seeing at other apartment complexes.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-reserve-apartment">
          Can I hold or reserve an apartment?
        </h3>
        <p>Yes, we ask for at least $200 (a "holding fee") that goes toward your initial move in costs (which is usually the first month's rent + the security deposit).</p>
        <p><em>This $200 is not refundable if you back out.</em> Once you pay it, we can wait until an agreed upon date for you to move in, but if you were to change your mind, we would not refund the $200 because we could have rented it to someone else while we were waiting for you.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="utilities-included">
          Do I just pay electric? What utilities are included in the rent?
        </h3>
        <p>Yes, you just pay electric. Water, sewer, and trash is included in the rent. Unlike a lot of buildings, we do not surprise you with extra fees every month on top of the rent.</p>
        <p>Electricity, cable, internet, Wi-Fi, or anything else is not included.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="gas-or-electric">
          Gas or electric?
        </h3>
        <p>
          All electric. All of the appliances are electric. You just have to pay your electric bill every month. In Las Vegas, at the moment, there is only <a href="https://www.nvenergy.com/my-account/ss-landing" target="_blank">one electric company</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="cable-options">
          What cable/internet/Wi-Fi can I get?
        </h3>
		<p>Cable/WiFi/etc. is not included in the rent. You must get it separately.</p>
        <p>
          You can use any cable company that services this area. The main ones are <a href="https://www.cox.com/residential/home.html" target="_blank">Cox Communications</a> and <a href="http://www.centurylink.com/local/nv/las-vegas.html" target="_blank">Century Link</a>.
        </p>
        <p>All our apartments are already wired for cable.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="satellite-dishes">
          Can I have a satellite dish?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We do not allow satellite dishes anymore. We are phasing them out for new move-ins.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="prorated-rent">
          What if I move in the middle of the month? Is the first month's rent prorated?
        </h3>
        <details>
          <summary>To move in, you must pay a full month's rent. Your next rent payment will be prorated—a smaller amount.</summary>
          <p>For example, let's say you move in on the 15th of June; there are 16 days left in the month. Before you move in, you pay the full rent, say, $800. Then next month, on July 1st, your rent is only 16 days worth of rent: $427.</p>
          <p>We just want the bigger amount of rent first. In the end, you only ever pay rent for the days you were actually here.</p>
        </details>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="security-deposit">
          How much is the security deposit?
        </h3>
        <p>Usually $200, but it depends on your application.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="no-admin-fees">
          Do you have admin fees?
        </h3>
        <p>No, we don't have admin fees. We don't have "cleaning deposits," "utility fees," or any hidden fees. You just pay the rent every month.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="application-fee">
          What's the application fee?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The cost to apply is currently <strong>$45 per adult</strong> as a money order. If you are paying with a credit card or debit card, the application fee is $50 per adult. These prices are subject to change without this statement on this website, or any other marketing material, being updated.  </p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="pest-control">
          Do you have pest control?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We have a professional pest control company that sprays for bugs <em>every single week</em>. If we get roaches, they're not here for long.
        </p>

	  </section>

	  <section>
		<h3 id="roaches">
		  Do these apartments have roaches and bed bugs?
		</h3>
		<p>
		  We have a professional pest control company that sprays for bugs <em>every single week</em> in apartments that need it—where we send them at resident request or preventatively.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You will never find an apartment that is immune to bugs. All apartments that share a wall with another apartment can get roaches. We can't control what people bring into their apartments. What we can control is getting rid of them fast before they spread, which is why we spray and fumigate often.

          <summary>Call (702) 327-8137</summary>
          <p>If you are locked out, be prepared to show a government-issued photo ID (that matches the name on the lease) and to <em>pay $40 cash to the employee who shows up to unlock your door</em>.</p>
          <p>Maintenance will only come out on an emergency call for serious issues like no air conditioning or a flood. Most other things, such as a clogged sink, will have to wait until the next business day.</p>

        <h3 id="when-is-rent-due">
          When is rent due?
        </h3>
        <p>Rent is due on the 1st of every month. But we don't charge late fees until after the 3rd, so the 3rd of every month is the last day to pay without late fees. If rent for the current month has not been paid by the 3rd day of any calendar month, the late fee incurred is 5% of that month's rent (which may be a higher rent if a rent increase was given) plus professional server costs.</p>
		<p>If you are a current resident, see your lease for the full and only authortative policy on late fees. What is written here or on any other promotional material does not constitute a rental agreement.</p>
      </section>

	  <section>
		<h3 id="buyout-fee">
		  What is the penalty for breaking the lease?
		</h3>
		<p>
		  2 months of rent. You must pay 2 months worth of rent <em>after</em> your move-out date. This is all in the rental agreement in greater detail.
